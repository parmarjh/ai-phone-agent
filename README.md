# AIPhoneAgent

AIPhoneAgent is a Gradio-based application that allows users to make API calls to `bland.ai` for phone-based tasks using a specified model. The application is designed to send tasks to a phone number provided by the user, with various customizable parameters.

## Features
- Make API calls with customizable task prompts to any internation phone number.
- Logging of API call details and responses.

## Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- `gradio`
- `requests`
- Python's built-in `logging` module (no need to install separately).

You can install the necessary packages using:
```bash
pip install gradio requests
```

## Usage
1. **Set up your environment**: Make sure Python is installed along with the required packages (`gradio` and `requests`).
2. **Get your API Key**: Create an account at [bland.ai](https://app.bland.ai/signup) and obtain your API key from the dashboard settings under the 'API Key' tab.
3. **Run the application**: Navigate to the project directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
   This will launch a Gradio interface where you can input your API key, the task description, and the phone number to which the call should be made.

4. **Interact with the interface**: Enter the required details in the Gradio web interface and submit to make the API call.
